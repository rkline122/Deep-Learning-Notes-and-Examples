## Chapter 4 Notes:

* The 3 most common ML tasks on vector data are:
    * Binary classification
    * Multiclass classification
    * Scalar regression

* Need to preprocess raw data before feeding it into a neural network
* When data has features of different ranges, scale each feature independently during preprocessing
* Watch for overfitting during training (results getting worse on unseen data)
* If you have a small amount of data, use a small model to mitigate overfitting
* If immediate layers are too small, you may cause information bottlenecks
* K-fold validation is useful for evaluating your model on small data
