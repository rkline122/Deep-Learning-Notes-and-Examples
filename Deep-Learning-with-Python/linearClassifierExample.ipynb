    "## Linear classifier in pure Tensorflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we are classifying samples based on their values (positive or negative). We start by randomly generating two sample sets, then combining them into a rank-2 tensor (matrix). We then define and run the training loop, and plot our predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm for the training loop is as follows:\n",
    "1. Drawing a batch of training samples with their corresponding targets\n",
    "2. Running the model to obtain predictions (forward pass)\n",
    "3. Compute the loss of the model on the batch\n",
    "4. Compute the gradient of the loss with regards to the model's parameters\n",
    "5. Moving the parameters in the opposite direction from the gradient, reducing the loss on the batch.\n",
    "6. Repeat until we are satisfied with the loss"
